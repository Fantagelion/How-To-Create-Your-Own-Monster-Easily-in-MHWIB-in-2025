# Time to mod!!
Howdy! Whether you're here because you're creating a huge mod that adds countless monsters or just to see how this tutorial explains Iceborne monster creation, you're welcome to drop a critic or ask for help in my discord (@shitendhisufiroa). 

## Requirements
- A copy of Monster Hunter World:Iceborne, PC version (preferably 15.xx.xx because these are the most used versions, and include Fatalis. My recommendation is 15.11.01 or 15.22 (you'll see later why)).

- The Stracker's Loader made for your game version : https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/1982?tab=files. Find the download that says is for your game version. This is because using an ulterior or anterior version will break the monster and quest loader, absolutely required to load custom quests and monsters.

- Stracker's move subspecies program (https://github.com/Strackeror/MHW-UtilityScripts/releases/download/0.3/move-subspecies.exe) : makes creating a new subspecies easy, instead of having to rename every file.

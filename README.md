# Time to mod!!
Howdy! Whether you're here because you're creating a huge mod that adds countless monsters or just to see how this tutorial explains Iceborne monster creation, you're welcome to drop a critic or ask for help in my discord (@shitendhisufiroa). 

## Requirements
- A copy of Monster Hunter World:Iceborne, PC version (preferably 15.xx.xx because these are the most used versions, and include Fatalis. My recommendation is 15.11.01 or 15.22 (you'll see later why)).
